			<font color="#5cceff" size="4">The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa
				and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at
				the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
				prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few
				adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
				large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
				opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
				prey on humans.</font>

			<font color="#5cceff" size="4">The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of
				the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white
				underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is
				territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to
				support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for
				about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.

			<font color="#5cceff" size="4">The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus
				Panthera, a member of the cat family, Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in some
				parts of Western and Central Asia, Southern Russia, and on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East
				Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by
				habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. The leopard is
				considered locally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United Arab
				Emirates, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in North Korea,
				Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Israel. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard
				occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.</font>
